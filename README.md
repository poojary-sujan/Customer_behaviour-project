# Customer_behaviour-project
A simple, end-to-end project where I analyze customer shopping behavior using SQL, Python, and Power BI. I clean the data, explore patterns, build visuals, and turn raw information into clear insights that help understand customer habits, spending trends, and key business opportunities.
