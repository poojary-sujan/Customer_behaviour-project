# Customer_behaviour-project
Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding customer shopping behavior through a complete end to end data analytics process. It uses SQL, Python and Power BI to explore how customers shop, what patterns exist in their purchases and how these insights can help a business make better decisions. The goal is to take raw data and transform it into a meaningful story that explains how customers act, what they prefer and how their habits influence overall performance.

The project begins with a clearly defined business context and ends with an interactive Power BI dashboard that presents insights in a simple and visually engaging way. Every stage of the analysis has been designed to reflect the real workflow followed in data analytics and business intelligence.

Business Problem

Every business wants to understand its customers better. This project aims to explore questions such as how much customers spend, how often they shop, which categories they are most interested in and how age and other demographic factors influence their choices. By understanding these behaviors, a company can identify growth opportunities, improve product decisions, plan targeted marketing strategies and enhance customer satisfaction.

The business problem focuses on identifying key behavioral patterns and translating them into actionable insights that support real decision making.

Features of This Project

This project includes a complete data cleaning and preparation phase in SQL followed by deeper exploration and visualization in Python. The results are summarized in a Power BI dashboard that presents the findings in a clear and interactive format. The project also includes a detailed business problem statement that explains the goals and relevance of the analysis. Finally, all code, data and documentation are included so anyone can access and run the full workflow.

Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer information such as age, gender, shopping category, purchase amount and frequency of visits. It provides the necessary details to understand spending behavior and demographic patterns. The data is stored in a simple spreadsheet format so that it can be used in SQL, Python and Power BI without any difficulty.

Tools and Technologies

The project makes use of SQL to clean the data, execute queries and explore the structure of the dataset. Python is used to perform exploratory data analysis and build visualizations that uncover hidden trends. Power BI is used to develop an interactive dashboard that presents insights in a clear and engaging format. Together, these tools create a smooth workflow from data preparation to insight generation.

Insights Summary

The analysis reveals powerful insights into customer spending habits, demographic patterns and category preferences. It becomes clear which groups spend more, which categories attract the most attention, which age groups show the highest engagement and what patterns appear across different customer segments. The dashboard brings these insights together in a way that business teams can understand and use.
